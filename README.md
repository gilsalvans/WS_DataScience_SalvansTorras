### Predicting hurricane speed movements 
This project uses historical hurricane data from the NHC (National Hurricane Center) which covers hurricane movements every 6h in the Atlantic from 1851 until 2015 to predict speed movements of each movement (6h) -for further information about the data checkout the metadata.pdf-. The calculated speed is the average speed movement of the hurricane the last 6 hours. In methodological terms, a Machine Learning technique (Gradient Boost Regressor) and a Neural Network technique (Fully Connected NN) are applied to predict the same phenomenon (speed); so afterwards they can be both compared.
