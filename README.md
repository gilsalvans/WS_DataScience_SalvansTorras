This repository corresponds to the Final Assignment of the course 20W856113: Introduction to Data Science and Machine Learning for Geospatial Data. 

### Assignment Title: Predicting hurricane speed movements 
This project uses historical hurricane data from the NHC (National Hurricane Center) which covers hurricane movements every 6h in the Atlantic from 1851 until 2015 -for further information about the data checkout the metadata.pdf (under /src)-. The main target of this study case is to predict the average speed of the next hurricane movement. The calculated speed is the average speed movement of the hurricane the last 6 hours. To do so, a Machine Learning technique (Gradient Boost Regressor) and a Neural Network approach (Fully Connected NN) are applied. Once the prediction problem is solved, an evaluation of the results and assessment of both methods is carried out.
